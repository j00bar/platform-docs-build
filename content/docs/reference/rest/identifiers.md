<div id="object-identifiers" class="section">


Objects MUST have a canonical ID across the portfolio of Insights
Platform applications, and users interacting with the API should be able
to use that canonical ID to access objects even though the underlying
individual application may use a different ID to refer to that object.
It is the responsibility of the application to translate from canonical
ID to the internal ID of the object, if applicable.
