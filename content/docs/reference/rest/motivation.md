Well-designed and developer-friendly REST APIs are critical for
high-quality and efficient development within a software ecosystem.
Applications and services within the Insights Platform should follow
these design guidelines to ensure consistency across different
applications. These guidelines are not necessarily meant to be
prescriptive, but instead outline a series of principles that can be
generally adhered to for a quality developer experience.

There are some excellent REST API development guidelines available
already. We will refer to them in various ways throughout the document,
and developers of APIs are encouraged to read these guidelines for
additional knowledge.
