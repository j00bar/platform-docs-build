Managing Resources with Role Based Access Control
=================================================

Users can control access to resources utilizing the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) service.  Only Account administrators can manage RBAC resources. In order to give users (including administrators) access of application resource, they must be added to a group. The associated group must then be granted access by being bound to a role or set of roles. A role defines access to specific application resources with defined permissions.
