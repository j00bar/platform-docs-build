While the API Gateway handles authentication of users for you, the Platform
leaves it up to every individual app to handle authorization. You get to decide
what users get what access to what API resources in your application. To help,
the Platform includes an RBAC policy service that assigns users to groups,
groups to roles, and roles to permissions. By the end of this section of the
tutorial, you should understand how to define permissions and enforce them in
your application
